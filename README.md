# StockHawk

This project is part of Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. 
Added enhancements to one app in order to make it production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, adding support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and data visualization via a library.
